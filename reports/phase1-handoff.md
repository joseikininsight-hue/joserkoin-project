## 🔍 CONTEXT FROM PHASE 1-A

### Critical Issues to Watch For

Based on Phase 1-A findings, pay special attention to:

1. **Memory Usage**
   - Check if AJAX handlers load large datasets
   - Look for array_walk/array_map on large arrays
   - Identify potential memory_limit issues

2. **Database Queries**
   - Count queries per AJAX request
   - Look for missing query result caching
   - Identify N+1 query patterns

3. **Response Times**
   - Check for long-running operations
   - Look for synchronous external API calls
   - Identify blocking operations

4. **Caching Opportunities**
   - Search for repeated database queries
   - Look for static data fetching
   - Identify cacheable API responses

### Known System Constraints

From Phase 1-A analysis:
- Memory limit: 256M (in admin area)
- No Redis/Memcached currently
- WordPress version: 5.8+ (recommended)
- PHP version: 7.4+ (required)
- Theme version: 9.1.0

### Integration Points

AJAX functions likely interact with:
- **Grant Custom Post Type**: 16 ACF fields
- **Taxonomies**: grant_category, grant_prefecture, grant_municipality, grant_tag
- **Database Tables**: gi_search_history, gi_user_preferences
- **AI Functions**: inc/ai-functions.php (Phase 1-C)
- **Google Sheets**: inc/google-sheets-integration.php (Phase 1-D)
